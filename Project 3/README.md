## Project Description
A large reason as to why I decided to go to Gettysburg College was because of Carol Cantele, who was the head coach of the Women’s Lacrosse team. She is an inspiration to all females in sports and she has left an everlasting impact on Gettysburg lacrosse and women’s lacrosse as a whole. She built the lacrosse program into a Division 3 powerhouse and the work she did does not go unnoticed in the accolades she has been awarded with. The purpose and inspiration behind this project was to display what hard-work and dedication towards something you truly enjoy can get you. In the 30 years here, Coach Cantele has won multiple NCAA Championships and Centennial Conference(CC) Championships, awarded CC Coach of the Year on multiple occasions, and finished it all with 451 career wins. The goal of this project is to display everything that she has accomplished and how her successes are the root of what Gettysburg Lacrosse is.
