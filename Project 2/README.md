## Project Description
This project explores the pay difference in professional sports between males and females. I was initially inspired to create this when I heard about Caitlin Clark’s rookie contract in the WNBA, and I was shocked to hear how little she was making through basketball. Once I began researching this, I discovered just how large the gender pay gap is in sports. In 2024, there was not a single woman on the list of the top 100 paid athletes. As a female athlete, it frustrates me that women will work to be the best in their sport, and yet they still don’t get paid as much as the 100th top paid male athlete. The goal of this project was to show the discrepancies in pay between females and males in sports, and show how much more females have to rely on endorsements to earn money rather than the sport itself.
