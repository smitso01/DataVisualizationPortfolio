## Project Description
This project explores the different reasons that marketers are relying on social media marketing for their jobs. I’ve always been interested in social media marketing, especially with the growth that social media has seen in the past decade. Now, marketing can be done on social media through advertisements, content on a companies’ page, endorsements, and influencer marketing. Since there is more social media marketing than ever these days, I was interested in seeing the purpose as to why marketers used social media marketing. The goal of this recreate project was to alter the original visual, which in my case was a radial bar graph, in a way that made the data more readable and understandable. In my final recreation, you can clearly see the different purposes and which reasons for social media marketing are higher than others, without the unnecessary non-data ink.
